      The Distance of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moon

     <div class="r-title">How well I know! – old Qfwfq cried,- the rest of you can't remember, but I can.</div>
     <div class="r-main">We had her on top of us all the time, that enormous Moon: when she was<br/> full – nights as bright as day, but with a butter-colored light – it looked<br/> as if she were going to crush us; when she was new, she rolled around the</br> sky like a black umbrella blown by the wind; and when she was waxing,</br> she came forward with her horns so low she seemed about to stick into</br> the peak of a promontory and get caught there. But the whole business</br> of the Moon's phases worked in a different way then: because the distances</br> from the Sun were different, and the orbits, and the angle of something or</br> other, I forget what; as for eclipses, with Earth and Moon stuck together the</br> way they were, why, we had eclipses every minute: naturally, those two big</br> monsters managed to put each other in the shade constantly, first one, then</br> the other.
      Orbit? Oh, elliptical, of course: for a while it would huddle against</br> us and then it would take flight for a while. The tides, when the Moon swung</br> closer, rose so high nobody could hold them back. There were nights when the</br> Moon was full and very, very low, and the tide was so high that the Moon missed</br> a ducking in the sea by a hair's-breadth; well, let's say a few yards anyway. Climb</br> up on the Moon? Of course we did. All you had to do was row out to it in a boat</br> and, when you were underneath, prop a ladder against her and scramble up.
    </br></br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But first, </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you?</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m fine.</div>
